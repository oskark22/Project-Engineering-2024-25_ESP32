# Project-Engineering-2024-25_ESP32

This repository hosts the code for the Arduino file used in my final-year project 2024-25. The Arduino file is responsible for processing NMEA sentences. The code extracts satellite IDs, types, and countries from GPS and GLONASS constellations. This information is sent to my Node.js backend using an HTTP POST request.
